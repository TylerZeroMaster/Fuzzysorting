# Fuzzysorting
 Some kind of sorting algorithm I made in 2017. It works by finding the "slope" of an array, and then using slope-intercept form to determine the approximate location where a number belongs. 
 It adds these approximations to contiguous lists of numbers with a similar approximate index.
 After each numberâ€™s position has been approximated, each list is bubble sorted and joined together to make one fully sorted list.
